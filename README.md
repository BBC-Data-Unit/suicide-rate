In December 2017 we added contextual data to a [story about a coffee cart manned by a Samaritans volunteer which had been set up at a railway station to try and help people who may be thinking of taking their own life](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-42395671).

The data [had been released that day by the ONS](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/suicidesintheunitedkingdom/2016registrations), and would not have justified a story on its own, but the story about the coffee cart provided the impetus to add a data treatment.
